# 🌍 Wander-lust

**Wander-lust** is a full-stack travel listing web application that allows users to explore, create, and manage travel destinations with image uploads, descriptions, and user authentication.  
It was developed as part of my web development learning journey and internship experience to demonstrate complete end-to-end deployment of a cloud-based Node.js application.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The main aim of Wander-lust is to provide a platform where users can:
- Browse various travel listings.
- Add their own destinations with details and images.
- Edit or delete listings with secure authentication.
- Manage images and data stored safely in the cloud.

This project helped me strengthen my full-stack web development skills, including backend APIs, database integration, and deployment handling using Render and MongoDB Atlas.
